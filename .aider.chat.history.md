The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` constants to match the new app details.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to generate the app logo.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized logo featuring a dynamic graph line overlaying a stylized globe, with vibrant colors representing real-time trading volume data. The background is a subtle gradient from deep blue to teal, giving a sense of depth and motion. The logo should convey technology, finance, and global connectivity, with a clean, modern aesthetic.
